# This logs and counts the number of users that       #
# access your page.  The 'log.dat' will remain        #
# hidden, but you do either with the counter (hidden  #
# or not). Also, it allows you the opportunity to     #
# exclude yourself from being added to both if you    #
# choose.                                             #
#                                                     #
