            <span class="text10">The <font color="#FF0000">Harvard Vietnamese Association (HVA)</font> was 
            founded in the early 1990's. Initially, <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font> was an outlet for 
            Vietnamese students to socialize with one another and to learn more 
            about Vietnamese culture. In 1993, the board unanimously voted to 
            rewrite the constitution to allow for more flexibility. The 
            President at that time, Dat I. Tu '95, believed that the changes 
            would &quot;give the president greater responsibility.&quot;
Tu also pointed out that the organization was &quot;moving away from its traditional 
            non political stance&quot; so that &quot;we can express our interests if we 
            want to.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;In the 
past it was different, we had no voice on campus,&quot; Tu said.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the years, <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font> has continued to promote culture, community, and 
            educational/political awareness at Harvard. It has become a vibrant 
            voice on campus for Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans and 
            maintains a strong dedication to the needs of the greater Boston 
            community. <br>
            <br>
            <span class="text11">CULTURE:</span><br>
            In 1992, the board promoted Vietnamese culture through food 
            festivals. Today, <font color="#FF0000">HVA's</font> annual 
            <font color="#FFCCFF">Southeast Asian night</font> is a cultural extravaganza which sells out each 
            year. Additionally, the <font color="#E2EDEB">Harvard  </font> 
            <font color="#CC9900">Vietnamese Dance &amp; Drama Troupe (HVDT) </font> 
            was created as an opportunity for students to embrace Vietnamese 
            culture through music and dance. In the past, <font color="#FF0000">
            HVA </font> has also invited numerous artists to speak and perform on 
            campus. In 2005, the board invited the poet-in-exile, 
            <font color="#99CCFF">Du Tu Le</font>. In 
            2004, the board invited composer <font color="#99CCFF">Pham Duy</font>. <br>
            <br>
            <span class="text11">COMMUNITY:</span><br>
            <font color="#FFCCFF">HVA </font>maintains a strong commitment to 
            building a warm community amongst its members. We are known on 
            campus for our friendliness and are often seen as a &quot;family.&quot; To promote cooperation and bonding,
            <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font> hosts two annual study breaks each 
            year - the <font color="#FFCCFF">Freshman study break</font> and the 
            <font color="#FFCCFF">Senior study break</font>. These 
            study breaks offer the new class a chance to get to know each other 
            and offers the old class a chance to reminisce over a final project. 
            Additionally, <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font>&nbsp; hosts an annual
            <font color="#FFCCFF">HVA retreat</font> for all members to bond 
            with one another. Past retreats have been 
            picnicking at the Arnold Arboretum, apple picking in New Hampshire, 
            and canoeing. We also have numerous social events throughout the 
            year including movie nights, parties, and meals.<br>
            <br>
            </span><span class="text11">POLITICS</span><span class="text10"><span class="text11">:</span><br>
            While <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font> has no official political 
            affiliation, we host political/educational events to foster a 
            greater understanding of the issues facing the Vietnamese and 
            Vietnamese American community.
            In 2003, the board hosted a film 
            series to discuss the works of <font color="#99CCFF">Tran Van Thuy</font>, a documentary 
            filmmaker whose films are highly controversial for their critique of 
            the Vietnamese Communist regime post-1975. The Co-President at that 
            time, Mai Anh Huynh '04, stated that this &quot;series of screenings is 
            the first of its kind sponsored by the <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font>.&quot; 
            In 2006, the board commemorated April 30th for the first time by 
            displaying information posters in Loker Commons and the Science 
            Center for two consecutive weeks. <br>

            In recent years, <font color="#FF0000">HVA</font> has&nbsp; modified 
            its 
            mission to incorporate Vietnamese American history and culture in 
            addition to Vietnamese history and culture. We recognize the 
            importance of understanding emerging narratives about the Vietnamese 
            American experience and offer a means for the Harvard community to 
            explore this culture. In 2005, the board hosted a film screening 
            entitled, &quot;Forging New Identities&quot; where we viewed films 
            such as <i>Saigon, USA 
            (2003)</i> and speaker Quang Tran '05 presented her senior thesis about 
            the Vietnamese 1.5 generation. <br>
