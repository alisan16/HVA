            <span style="font-size: 8pt">HVA Language table is an opportunity 
            for interested members to practice their Vietnamese language skills 
            over a casual dinner. Feel free to drop by, whether you are a native 
            speaker or an interested learner. While we try to speak entirely in 
            Vietnamese during this meal, we recognize that members have varying 
            levels of fluency so we will also speak in English. Please do not 
            hesitate to join us because you are unsure of your fluency level. 
            Everyone is welcomed and everyone is here to learn. There is no set 
            schedule. You are not obligated to attend on a weekly basis and you 
            may arrive/leave at your leisure. </span></span><p class="text10">

            opportunity to catch up with one another so come grab a meal with us 
            - even if you're just there to eat.</span></span><p class="text10">
            <span class="text6"><span style="font-size: 8pt">We hope you'll join 
            us this Wednesday! New members and guests are always welcome.</span></span>
