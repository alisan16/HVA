            <span class="text10">The Hepatitis B Initiative works extensively 
            with the Malden and Chinatown community. It consists of a public 
            policy component, a clinical component, and an awareness component. 
            Its mission is to mobilize students to help communities prevent 
            hepatitis B and its consequences amongst at-risk groups. Vietnamese 
            Americans are particularly high risk and HepBI is always looking for 
            more Vietnamese-speaking volunteers. HepBI accomplishes its mission 
            by developing outreach materials, launching educational campaigns, 
            and providing free screenings and vaccinations to all. In Summer 
            2006, HepBI will launch its 3rd clinic site in Dorchester, MA. 
            Volunteers must commit at least 4 hours/week on Tuesdays 6-10pm or 
            Saturdays 9-1pm. <br>

international non-profit group formed in 1915. TNTT works with youth ages 4-18 
and mentors students through prayer, Eucharist, sacrifice, and discipleship. It 
is a fusion of spiritual and outdoor activity.&nbsp; Volunteers teach a Sunday 
school course for students which focuses on bible study. This course also 
emphasizes scouting techniques such as Semaphore, Morse code and knot tying. 
Additionally, volunteers plan and organize regular camping trips, retreats, and 
cultural events. These include choreographing Vietnamese skits and dance 
performances. There are currently four TNTT branches within the vicinity of 
Harvard - Malden, Dorchester, East Boston and Chelsea. <br>
