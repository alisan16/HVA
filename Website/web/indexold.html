<strong>What's Bar Girls?
    </strong><br>

A film that has shaken audiences with its potent combination of sex, drugs, and HIV/AIDS, set against a stark portrayal of the lives of young prostitutes, is just as effectively forcing Vietnam's film industry to take a long, hard look at itself.
 <br>   
Moviegoers gape at graphic scenes like a gang rape and a tight close-up of a young girl injecting heroin into a pale arm, and the film's grim urban setting?a startling departure from the usual conservative cinematic themes is striking the right note with young audiences.

	<h2><font color="red">An Invitation from NAVSA</font></h2>
	
    <p><strong>What: Dim Sum Get-Together for VSAs Leaders<br>

Date: Saturday- October, 29, 2005.<br>
Time: 10 AM<br>

Location: China Pearl Restaurant, Chinatown Boston</strong><br>
Why: Because we love dim sum! But more importantly, because we care about our Vietnamese women!<br>
</p>
    <p><strong>Hello To All!</strong></p>
    <p>I have noticed that it has been very quiet as of late in regards to communications between the VSAs (specifically the eboard members) of each schools.
    Having said that, I would like to propose a dim sum trip for all of the eboard members of each school.<br>
    This would be a GREAT chance for everyone to meet and get to know each other. We can get updates as to what events each VSAs are up to. We can say hi to old friends we haven't seen in a long time, or introduce ourselves to those we often see around Boston but do not know. Even more important, we can share ideas and offer each other help to build and grow our VSAs.
    Talking about helping each other, the North American Vietnamese Students Association (NAVSA) is pushing a national fundraising event to help Vietnamese women who are victims of the infamous sex trade. A "relay-for-life"-style event has been in the happening in California, Chicago, Minnesota, Washington D.C., and Vancouver. I trongly believe BOSTON should be a part of this philanthropic event!!!!
    As we convene for our dim sum trip, more information will be provided! I promise :)<br>

    OK. Here is the tough part. So many people want to come, yet not everyone's schedules are the same.<br>

    I took the liberty to decide that the best time when we can get the majority of the representatives will be a Saturday morning. I am proposing the following:<br>
    What: Dim Sum Get-Together for VSAs Leaders<br>
    Date: Saturday- October, 29, 2005.<br>
    Time: 10 AM<br>
    Location: China Pearl Restaurant, Chinatown Boston<br>

    Why: Because we love dim sum! But more importantly, because we care about our  
            Vietnamese women!<br>

          The date can change if a significant amount of us won't be able to make it.<br>
