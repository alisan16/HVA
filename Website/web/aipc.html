The Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional<br>
Studies (APAICS) is currently accepting applications from college students<br>
for its summer internship program. The application deadline is January 30.<br>
<br>
Every year, APAICS selects ten to twelve students for a first-hand learning<br>
experience in American politics. Interns work in congressional offices,<br>
federal agencies, and non-profit organizations in Washington DC. Placements<br>
last summer included three offices in the House of Representatives, the<br>
Congressional Research Service, the Department of Housing and Urban<br>
Development, the Department of Labor, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,<br>
and the National League of Cities. Through a series of seminars, they learn<br>
about national Asian Pacific Islander American advocacy organizations and<br>
network with peers from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and the<br>
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.<br>
<br>
The APAICS internship program encourages the political and civic involvement<br>
of young Asian Pacific Islander American, fosters their interest in careers<br>
in politics and public policy, and develops their leadership skills.<br>
<br>
Interns receive a stipend of $2500 for the period from June 7 to July 30.<br>
The interns come from all regions of the country and represent many segments<br>
of the Asian Pacific Islander American community. Applicants must<br>
demonstrate an interest in public service.<br>
<br>
